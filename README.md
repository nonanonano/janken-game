# janken-game

This repository contains a very small janken (rock–paper–scissors) game written in HTML and JavaScript. To play, simply open `index.html` in your web browser and choose Rock, Paper or Scissors. The computer's choice will appear using the images stored in the `aitenogazou` folder, and the page will display whether you win, lose or tie.
